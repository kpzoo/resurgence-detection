# resurgence-detection
Code to show fundamental delays in detecting resurgence from incidence

Presents Matlab files to reproduce analyses in the paper: "Fundamental limits on inferring epidemic resurgence in real time" by Kris V Parag and Christl A Donnelly published in PLOS computational biology at https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010004.

Methodology can be found in the above paper and the underlying R(t) estimates use the EpiFilter package, which is available at https://github.com/kpzoo/EpiFilter
